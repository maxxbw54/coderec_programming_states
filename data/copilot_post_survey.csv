I haven't analyzed data using Python for a couple months now so all of the functions I would usually use slipped my mind. Collaborating with Copilot felt like I was googling what I wanted to do except instead of going through several stack overflow links that Google would show me, the code just appeared inline saving me time and keeping my flow of coding. Looking forward to using Copilot more in the future now! ",,Disagree,

However, I worry that bugs can sneak-in and go unnoticed, especially in weakly-dynamically typed languages. Use of copilot with statically and strongly typed languages seems best to me and with automatic test case generation, copilot is going to take software development into a new maturity level. It was great to be a part of this study and I am happy to contribute further as well.",Agree,Strongly Disagree,Agree

It would be cool if Copilot could estimate how confident it is about a given suggestion with some sort of chain of evidence that this is the current best way of doing things that I could double check myself with some online web searches and so on.,,Disagree,
